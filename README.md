# The-Z-Box
An Android app with all the necessary things innit (clock, calculator etc), a chat, some minigames and awesome people working on it (currently fanti, demonslayer, helperduck). Oh, and don't forget that there are a bunch of easter eggs too!

If you are interested in a revshare project to learn Unity and enjoy and you have some skills (for example a programmer, a music maker, an helper, a game-tester), please DM me: I'm fanti#2609 on Discord.
